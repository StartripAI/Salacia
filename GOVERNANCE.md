# Governance

## Project Model

Salacia is maintainer-led with transparent decisions recorded in PRs and release notes.

## Roles

- Maintainers: roadmap, review, releases, security response.
- Contributors: code, tests, docs, issue triage.

## Decision Process

1. Proposals discussed in issue or PR.
2. Maintainer review and requested changes.
3. Merge once quality gates pass.

## Release Authority

Only maintainers can create stable tags and GitHub releases.
Release requires green CI and release gate evidence.
